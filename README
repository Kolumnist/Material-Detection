### Docker Setup

---
### Local Setup

#### Install conda and dependencies

Create conda environment: 
`conda create --name *insert_name* python=3.10`

Activate created environment:
`conda activate *insert_name*`

Install ultralytics for yolov8 training:
`pip install ultralytics`

Put all images and labels inside the data folder and make sure that the different label classes are inside the yolov8_config.yaml

Train yolov8 model via Python:
`python src/train.py`

Install googlepubsub to send data there:
`pip install google-cloud-pubsub`

Make sure to get a service account json file from google console and change the path in the predict_webcam.py

Next make sure to create a topic and fill in all the necessary data into the predict_webcam.py


Currently using Http also tried using mqtt however pubsub doesnt like mqtt unless one uses a bridge.

Also furthermore one could use Websockets. Use of API Cloud Functions also useful to acknowledge data that is received by subscription.

There is too much I need hydration

#### Python
Use the train.py file

#### Console
yolo detect train data=yolov8_config.yaml model="yolov8n.pt" epochs=1

if things go bad use:
`pip uninstall -y -r <(pip freeze)`


Tried out to
[install LabelStudio locally conda:](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio?tab=readme-ov-file#install-locally-with-anaconda)
didn't quite work out...
